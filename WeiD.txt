Hello everyone, my name is Wei Du.

Three words that describe me: hard-working, creative, curious.

I like the art of photography, most picture bring out my curiosity.

My favorite animal is cat, two of them live with my wife and me. 

Lastly, I am looking forward to become a good programer through Lambda School courses.
